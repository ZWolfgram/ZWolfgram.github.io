# Solving Poisson's Equation Using Brownian Motion Using Octave

##Overview
<sup><sub>Partial differential equations are very complex, and difficult problems to derive forms of exact solutions unless using assumptions to make solutions easier to derive. Because of this, many domains that are solved with these equations are of simple geometries leaving the challenge of trying to look at more obscure domains. One possible solution to this problem is using the Feynman-Kac formula to derive an approximate mapping of the PDE. This post will go through the basic ideas of what is needed to make a solver of this type and some examples of typical solutions.</sub></sup>

## **What is the Feynman-Kac Formula for the case of a Poisson Equation**

#### Some T-SQL Code

```tsql
SELECT This, [Is], A, Code, Block -- Using SSMS style syntax highlighting
    , REVERSE('abc')
FROM dbo.SomeTable s
    CROSS JOIN dbo.OtherTable o;
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
